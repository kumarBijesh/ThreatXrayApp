 Threat X-Ray

 Threat X-Ray is a cybersecurity-focused web application that helps users scan files, URLs, and images for hidden threats, malicious content, and privacy risks.
 It’s designed to give everyday users more control over their digital safety.

 Objective
 -> Build an easy-to-use web tool to detect threats in files, links, and images.
 -> Help users identify malware, suspicious metadata, or embedded payloads, and give them the option to clean or keep the data.

  Technologies Used

 -> Python, Flask – for backend processing and handling scans

 -> HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for frontend UI and reports

 -> File scanning and URL analysis libraries

 -> Metadata extraction tools for images

 Key Features

  -> Scans files and URLs for potential malicious content

  -> Detects hidden metadata or embedded payloads in images

  -> Lets users remove or keep sensitive metadata after reviewing analysis

  -> Generates simple, clear threat reports in a user-friendly interface

   Skills & Learning

  -> Gained hands-on experience in threat detection and data sanitization

  -> Improved backend API logic with Python and Flask

  -> Designed frontend dashboards to make threat data easy to understand

  -> Learned real-world scanning and privacy practices

  Impact & Relevance to Analyst Roles

  -> Demonstrates strong understanding of threat detection, risk assessment, and secure data handling.

  -> Reflects analytical thinking and problem-solving — key for cybersecurity and data analyst roles.

  -> Shows ability to communicate findings clearly through reports, aligning with tasks like incident reporting and risk analysis.

  How It's Different

Unlike typical tools that only scan files or URLs, Threat X-Ray also scans images for hidden metadata and embedded payloads, 
giving users more privacy control. It combines multiple checks in one platform to make threat analysis simpler and more complete.
